Throughout the college semester, this assignment has taught us the fundamentals of HTML and CSS, as well as introduced us to concepts such as Markdown, color manipulation, and content organization. We learned how to design websites that meet the basic needs of most businesses and individuals while incorporating our own creative touch. 

One important lesson I learned from these assignments is the importance of time management and how much work can pile up. Attention to small details is something else I have developed an OCD for as it not only has a significant impact on the user experience but also when developing the code. Web development also requires knowledge of internet protocols, such as HTTP and HTTPS.

In addition, we have learned about good file management practices, such as saving files in the appropriate folder and format, naming files correctly, and determining the parent/root directory.
