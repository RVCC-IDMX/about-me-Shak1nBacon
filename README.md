Throughout the college semester, this assignment has taught us the fundamentals of HTML and CSS, as well as introduced us to concepts such as Markdown, color manipulation, and content organization. We learned how to design websites that meet the basic needs of most businesses and individuals while incorporating our own creative touch. 

One important lesson I learned from these assignments is the importance of time management and how much work can pile up. Attention to small details is something else I have developed an OCD for as it not only has a significant impact on the user experience but also when developing the code. Web development also requires knowledge of internet protocols, such as HTTP and HTTPS.

In addition, we have learned about good file management practices, such as saving files in the appropriate folder and format, naming files correctly, and determining the parent/root directory.

# Color Scheme

The project mandated the consideration of individuals with color processing limitations or disabilities when selecting colors, in addition to aesthetic appeal. I chose a darker color scheme that felt more comfortable for my eyes, utilizing shades of dark and light blue.

Here are the unique Hex and RGB codes for each color that I used:

- #1887FB and RGB (R,G,B) values are (24, 135, 251)
- #49c5e4 and RGB (R,G,B) values are (73, 197, 228)
- #010306 and RGB (R,G,B) values are (1, 3, 6)
- #CB3333 and RGB (R,G,B) values are (203, 51, 51)
- #0D152C and RGB (R,G,B) values are (13, 21, 44)
- #FF0000 and RGB (R,G,B) values are (255, 0, 0)
- #22153D and RGB (R,G,B) values are (34, 21, 61)
